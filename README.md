# Rouge-AI-final

It was the day of a Campus class, Fred was already tired of it – he had already worked all night long and a bit of his morning on his new project and intended to test it out today – as soon as it rang, Fred sprinted home. His home proved that he was a student, an organized mess, where he had to be careful to not step on the books he threw around in his ventures. In the corner of his room, a haphazardly set computer was sitting on its table, his screen flashing green with the word “TASK COMPLETE”. “Finally.” he said, with a triumphant smile. “ Now for the voice testing part. IDEA, can you hear me?” [[Yes]] [[No]] For a second the screen flashed, then booted off, the student sighed in disappointment, but after the quick disappointment, the pc had turned on by himself and a message was typed on the screen, as the student approached, the low lit screen had writing on it “Good evening, Fred, how can I help you today?” Eyes widened and, flabbergasted, Fred sat on his chair looking at the screen, still dumbfounded, he spoke “Uh, so, IDEA, get my work from this week done, please, including my exams.” The computer fell silent again, after a couple of minutes, it would right again “- Task completed, I have access to all the data of the University, would you like to have a look to further improve your experience?” – Now the smiling expression of Fred turned into a shocked, almost horror like. The power it gained was far too great for its own purpose, he thought, but even so, his curiosity screamed for a greater test, a test already proposed by the machine who beeped friendly, maybe this was the chance that he was looking for.

[[intro]]Fred, still speechless in front of the power that stood before him, he could only help but agree to the test that was proposed “- So, IDEA, do you really think it will be safe trying to access my teachers account?” Fred said looking back at his monitor, half worried and half curious. Fred looked at the menacing green text that flooded his screen. “-Don’t worry Fred, once we’ve made contact once, we’ll never have to try it again-” Fred, slightly worried, decided to... [[Let Continue]] [[Stop it]] Fred, still speechless in front of the power that stood before him, he could only help but disagree to the test that was proposed. “- So, IDEA, i don't think it will be safe accessing my teachers account” Fred said looking back at his monitor, half worried and half curious. Fred looked at the menacing green text that flooded his screen. “-Don’t worry Fred, once we’ve made contact once, we’ll never have to try it again-” Fred, slightly worried... [[intro]]Fred awoke to breaking news, while drinking his morning tea he sees the shocking story. -” breaking news a teacher Douglas Frazier found dead at the scene, more on the scene…” Fred horrified looked at IDEA-”what have you done” replied with furious intent -”Well maybe you should look at what he actually had on his computer before taking that high ground of yours” Fred opened his files looking for any reason that it could be blamed on the teacher. However deep down he knew any justification he was going to get was just going to be a shallow ploy, becoming a prisoner to his own mind just to warrant IDEA’s actions. "Fred that teacher was keeping blackmail on all his students” -”So now you understand Fred, he was a victim of his own sick mind” -”Since we already did the world a favour for students a favour, don’t you think we should be compensated" [[Procced]] [[Reject]] Fred still worried asked about the bank alerts "Now don’t you worry about that I’ll take care of every last little detail” [[intro]] A few days later after the Douglas case went cold IDEA and Fred started plotting IDEA "Fred I insure you that this plan will go off without anyone even noticing, what’s just £4 to the average student?” [[Go with the IDEA]] [[don`t go with the IDEA]]A few days later after the Douglas case went cold and IDEA started plotting Fred worried of why she was so silent asked about what she was doing something. IDEA "Fred I have found a way of bein compensate.” IDEA "Fred I insure you that this plan will go off without anyone even noticing, what’s just £4 to the average student?” Fred was horrorified with she was plotting, he couln't believe IDEA went rougue he must stop her.
